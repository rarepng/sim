### wasm implementation of mass spring system simulations


#### the scary exe is only used on windows a thin shim for emscripten because intellisense & cmake refuse to work with ps1 or bat scripts on windows. If you would rather compile it yourself you can find it [here](https://github.com/rarepng/emshim) / I will add it as a submodule later on.

#### typescript types generation currently is only manual. i cant figure out how to make cmake find tsc.
